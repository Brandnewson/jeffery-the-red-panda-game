<h1>Jeffery, the red panda</h1>

<h2> :sparkles:Ambition: </h2>
I wanted to make my own game where a Red Panda called Jeffery could walk around!

<h2> :pencil:Method: </h2>

Drew up a Red Panda with Pixel art, inclusive of the walking animations and uploaded it into a spritesheet.
I then used CSS to centre the panda, and transition to certain images in the spritesheet based on the arrows keys.
Only allowing the user to explore a limit to the image, it gives the impression that there are borders in the world.

The program has the features:

- Custom Drawn Red Panda called Jeffery
- On-screen D-pad for movement
- Walking animation and shadows
- Arrow Key compatibility
- Game Borders to prevent Jeffery from falling over
